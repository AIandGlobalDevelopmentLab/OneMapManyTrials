# Simulations

This directory contains the code and scripts used to run the simulations in the paper. The main simulation script is `simulations_with_bias_correction.ipynb`, which produces all the results presented in the paper.

The notebook `tweedies_formula.ipynb` shows some additional simulated motivations for the use of Tweedie's formula in the context of the paper. It is not used in the main analysis but provides additional insights into the theoretical underpinnings of the methods used.
